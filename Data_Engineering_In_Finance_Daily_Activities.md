- Data Extraction: The process involves retrieving tables (columns) from both Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle databases. A query is made to obtain transaction details containing column information from both the Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server databases. The challenge lies in effectively joining the column specifics from the Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server databases to attain the necessary comprehensive transaction details.
Additionally, there exist distinct SQL languages tailored for diverse data operations:
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: This language deals with modifying and managing data within the database.
- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Pertains to the management of permissions and access rights to the data.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**: Focuses on managing the transactional aspects of the database, like committing or rolling back transactions.
- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Involves defining and altering the structure of the database objects.
- **DSL (Domain Specific Language)**: A specialized language addressing specific domains or industries.

To create a selected table from two tables joined and queried in Oracle SQL with indexes to help increase query speed.
-- Step 1: Create the Joined Table
CREATE TABLE JoinedTable AS
SELECT
    t1.column1 AS t1_column1,
    t1.column2 AS t1_column2,
    t2.column3 AS t2_column3,
    t2.column4 AS t2_column4
FROM Table1 t1, Table2 t2 WHERE t1.common_column = t2.common_column;
-- Step 2: Create Indexes on the Joined Table
CREATE INDEX idx_t1_column1 ON JoinedTable(t1_column1);
CREATE INDEX idx_t2_column3 ON JoinedTable(t2_column3); -- Note: Adjust the column names and data types according to your actual tables.
